To Do:

1. Create Model Relationship between book and author so I can reference both.

2. If a book is in a users library replace that add to library button with a delete from library button.

3. Handle the author name better. 
	Maybe change the model so it's just Author name?
	What about Multiple Authors?

4. Add users book_club posts to user page.
	For cleaner looking posts I think I'll put it like:
		| Book img | Post Title | Post | Last Activity |
				     COL Width	
		|     2    |     3      |  5   |      2        |

	Maybe change the way the books are listed to a similar pattern.
		| Book Img | Book Title | Auth |  Description  | Delete |
				     COL Width
		|     2    |     3      |  2   |       4       |   1	|

5. Book Club
	First when adding to book club the form needs to validate and list the selected books.
		Book Title | Author
		Each book title will be a radial field that allows you to select only one.

	Second when book is selected the user will push the submit button that will appear and it will post to the Book_Club DB.
