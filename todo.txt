To Do:

1. Create Model Relationship between book and author so I can reference both.

2. If a book is in a users library replace that add to library button with a delete from library button.

3. Handle the author name better. 
	Maybe change the model so it's just Author name?
	What about Multiple Authors?

4. Add users book_club posts to user page.
	For cleaner looking posts I think I'll put it like:
		| Book img | Post Title | Post | Last Activity |
				     COL Width	
		|     2    |     3      |  5   |      2        |

	Maybe change the way the books are listed to a similar pattern.
		| Book Img | Book Title | Auth |  Description  | Delete |
				     COL Width
		|     2    |     3      |  2   |       4       |   1	|
