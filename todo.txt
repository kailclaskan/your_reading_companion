To Do:

1. Limit the number of books displayed on the books page. Maybe 10 per page.

2. Figure out the denied requests.
	I want to send them back to the user who will click on a button and open a form to change the request.
	They should also have the option to delete the request if they don't want to request any longer.

3. Can now add/view books that start with a #, but still can't view books that start with a .

4. Update the top books section.
	EITHER:
		Update the way things are done and instead pull from the database.
			This means that instead of loading from the api, we're going to check, then add to the database.
			May also need to add a date added to a new model that is only for the top books.
	OR:
		Update the books model so the most viewed books, or most popular club books are in the top books section.
			This actually sounds a lot more fun. Like have it list the top x books based on views (Number of clicks) and club popularity (Number of comments) [x + y]

5. List the books in a different way on the index.
	Maybe:
		#   |   Image   |   Title   |   Author

6. Add the most popular book clubs to the bottom of the page.
	Have to count the number of comments on the book to find the most popular.

7. Adjust the posted date for all models with a date so it shows in format MM/DD/YYYY

8. Set up the Password Reset, Role Update, Info Update and Remove User buttons in the User Account Settings menu.

9. Make sure that the user can't write reviews, view clubs, or create clubs unless they're signed in.

10. Change the book club comments to bubbles maybe? The post too possibly. Make it more exciting.
	Comments need to be centered as well.

11. Review written by test had Kail_Claskan as the user, need to fix that.
	Shows up in database as written by test.

12. Book Reviews need to be fully viewable on the books page.

13. Make the User details on the user details page centered maybe? Just make it look nicer.
	Center the Library section.
	Add a created and commented clubs section.

14. In line with the denials place an inbox in the navigation section.
	Users can receive mail from administration, not send.
	This is how the users can find out about their required updates.
	Maybe add a messaging service for user to user contact.
