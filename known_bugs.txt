Bugs:

1. Can't select books that begin with #
	Also has trouble loading books that begin with . 

2. Adding a book to your library refreshes the search page.
	It should just add and flash, but not refresh in case a user wants to add more books from the same query.

3. The Home Page takes FOREVER to load. I suspect it has something to do with the way I'm trying to load the books.
	I pull the books from the NYT Api and then filter them through the google API so I can pull all the book covers.
	Prior to pulling from google it loaded far faster.

4. When attempting to view a books details the first time it says NoneType object has no attribute query.
	The second time it's added to the system.

5. IF there is no page count or category the system fails.
	Need an if, else statement.

6. Once in a while it finds the wrong title and tries to add that. Maybe cause I'm querying with .first()?

7. IF you view the book and then attempt to add it, it says it's already in your library, but it's not.

8. If you remove all books from your library 1 remains in the DB, however it doesn't display on the users detail page.
	ALSO you can't add them to your library again after you've removed them.
