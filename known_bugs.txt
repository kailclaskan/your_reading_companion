Bugs:

1. Can't select books that begin with #
	Also has trouble loading books that begin with . 

2. Adding a book to your library refreshes the search page.
	It should just add and flash, but not refresh in case a user wants to add more books from the same query.

3. The Home Page takes FOREVER to load. I suspect it has something to do with the way I'm trying to load the books.
	I pull the books from the NYT Api and then filter them through the google API so I can pull all the book covers.
	Prior to pulling from google it loaded far faster.

5. IF there is no page count or category the system fails.
	Need an if, else statement.

6. Once in a while it finds the wrong title and tries to add that. Maybe cause I'm querying with .first()?
